# SwiftSDAIap242

exp2swift translated STEP AP242ed2 schema.

by Tsutomu Yoshida, Minokamo Japan.

This is a full translation of ISO 10303-242:2020 schema (AP242 2nd edition) into the Swift programing language.
To use this package, SwiftSDAIcore runtime environment package is required.

Some sample programs are provided in separate repositories (see below).

AP242 translation is performed using the updated EXPRESS AP242 schema definition provided as a diff patch file contained in this package (instead of the one provided under STEPswiftcode package listed below).
version 1.1.0 translation contains numerous function definitions missing from the original AP242 schema definition.
